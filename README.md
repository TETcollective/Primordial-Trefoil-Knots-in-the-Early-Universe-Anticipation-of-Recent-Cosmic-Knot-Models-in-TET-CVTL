## Abstract

A 2025 study in *Physical Review Letters* (Eto, Hamada, Nitta) demonstrated that stable topological knots ("cosmic knots") can form in the early universe, dominate a brief cosmological era, and generate baryogenesis through quantum tunneling decay.

This work shows that these ideas — a primordial vacuum dominated by stable topological knots with braiding and decay driving cosmological evolution — were anticipated years earlier within the **Topology & Entanglement Theory (TET-CVTL)** framework.

TET-CVTL posits an **eternal vacuum saturated by primordial trefoil knots** ($3_1$, linking number $L_k=6$), the unique stable configuration under Chern-Simons minimization and eternal Ising braiding. These structures underlie parameter-free derivations of $G$ and $\Lambda$, axion-like dark matter, and embodied consciousness as qualia curvature.

The convergence with recent mainstream research confirms the prescience of the topological vacuum paradigm.
