# Primordial-Trefoil-Knots-in-the-Early-Universe-Anticipation-of-Recent-Cosmic-Knot-Models-in-TET-CVTL
Paper exploring how the Topology &amp; Entanglement Theory (TET-CVTL) anticipated key elements of recent cosmic knot models (Eto, Hamada, Nitta – PRL 2025). The primordial trefoil-saturated vacuum (L_k=6) as foundation for cosmology, matter generation, and embodied consciousness.
